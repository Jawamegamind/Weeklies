## 🧠 Project Overview

**Weeklies** is a **full-stack Flask web application** developed as part of *CSC 510* : Software Engineering (Fall 2025, NC State University)*.  
It models a modern food-delivery system where users can register, browse restaurants and menus, tag preferences, and schedule future meal orders via an integrated calendar.  
The project demonstrates **modular backend design**, **frontend interaction**, **LLM-assisted personalization**, and **continuous documentation & testing pipelines**.

## 🧪 Continuous Integration

Every push or pull request to the `main` branch triggers:
1. **CI tests** via `pytest` and `coverage`  
2. **Documentation build & deployment** to GitHub Pages (`gh-pages` branch)  
3. **Static analysis** via `ruff` and `black` 

You can view live status from the badges above.

| **Kunal Jindal** | [@devkunal2002](https://github.com/devkunal2002) | Designed and automated documentation pipeline using `pdoc`. Authored Installation Guide and main README. Set up CI/CD workflows, repository structure, and code quality badging. Contributed to backend testing and verification. |
| **Ashritha Bugada** | — | Developed restaurant search, menu browsing, and ordering flow. Designed dynamic menu templates and integrated frontend-backend routes for order placement. Assisted with usability testing and validation. |
| **Daniel Dong** | — | Implemented backend for calendar scheduling and integrated LLM module for personalized recommendations. Supported expansion of core Flask app and contributed to end-to-end feature debugging. |
| **Jawad Saeed** | [@Jawamegamind](https://github.com/Jawamegamind) | Implemented Reviews & Ratings feature to allow users to deliver verdict on their orders and for restaurants to see their average ratings. Implemented restaurant dashboard with end-to-end order functionality where restaurants can accept/reject orders. Helped with the creation of unit and end-to-end workflow tests for implemented features and added support for Metal Performance Shaders for faster LLM inference on Apple Silicon devices. |
| **Omkar Joshi** | [@OJ98](https://github.com/OJ98) | Implemented the Analytics Dashboard feature providing restaurant owners detailed insights into order patterns, revenue metrics, and customer behavior. Enhanced LLM toolkit with GPU acceleration support (CUDA/MPS/CPU priority). Optimized CI/CD pipeline to prevent disk exhaustion on GitHub Actions runners. Added comprehensive test coverage improvements and resolved pytest configuration issues for cross-platform compatibility. |
